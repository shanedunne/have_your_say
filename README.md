# Have Your Say

Have Your Say is an adaptable application designed for local governments, companies, or groups. It empowers users to petition representatives on issues or improvements, fostering transparency and collaboration. When a petition gathers enough support, representatives must respond with a proposal, giving users a greater say in decision-making.

This application leverages Java with Spring Boot for the backend and React for the frontend.

## Basic Concept

### Petitions
Group members can create petitions to address issues or propose changes. Each petition requires a predetermined quota of support votes before being escalated to representatives. Users can vote to support or oppose petitions, enabling direct engagement.

### Proposals
When a petition meets its support quota, representatives must respond with a formal proposal. This response can either:
- Explain why the petition is not viable, or
- Outline an actionable proposal based on the petition’s goals.

Once submitted, users vote on the proposal’s outcome, and representatives are expected to act on the result, ensuring accountability and progress.
